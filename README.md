# CS115-Project-AInfant

AInfant is an Android application that approaches Artificial Intelligence in a new way. Rather than the AI having the ability to use known language, AInfant has the ability to learn new words unknown to its database.

AInfant will take in a user's sentence and give feedback on its grammatical correctness and returns whether there are words inputted by the user unknown to its database. If a word is unknown to the AI, the user has the opportunity of teaching this specific word to the AI with its given part of speech and connotations.
